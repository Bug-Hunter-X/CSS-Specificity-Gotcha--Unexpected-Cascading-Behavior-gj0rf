The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this example, both selectors target the `p` element. However, the first selector (`div p`) is more specific because it targets a `p` element that is a direct child of a `div` element.  Therefore, even if a `p` element is not nested within a `div`, the first selector might still win due to the cascade and specificity.

The issue arises when you expect the second, simpler selector to override the first. You might think that the more general rule is always overridden by a more specific rule, but due to the way CSS specificity is calculated, you can have unexpected outcomes.  The cascade can result in unexpected behavior if not meticulously designed.
